# Hello

My name is Alex.  This is my blog.  I am a data scientist working in commerical property and casualty insurance where a lot of challenges exist to be solved.  

My personal interests fall into four main catergories:
 
 1.  Music
 2.  Books
 3.  Games
 4.  Cooking

# World

I expect that this blog will live deep down in the dark depths of the unread internet.  Nonetheless, I plan on using this as a place to document data science and other projects I'm working on.

I primarily code in [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and plan to contribute to the [Casualty Actuarial Society's](https://github.com/casact) open source projects.
